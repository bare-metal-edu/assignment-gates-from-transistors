## Truth tables

Complete the `truth` tables for the three circuits that you completed in this activity. In addition,
link to each of the schematics you made for the circuits in `TinkerCAD`.

## Speculation

> Describe the functionalities of the `NAND` and `NOR` gates in your own words. How do they differ from the
> other logic circuits we've built?

`TODO`

> This part of the lab reused some principles from a specific gate constructed in the `Fundamental branch` of
> the assignment. Which gate was it? What principles did you use?

`TODO`

> What's the point of doing this work? Does this logic enable us to do anything more than the basic `3` gates
> constructed in the `Fundamental` branch? If so, what are some examples of how you might use them?
