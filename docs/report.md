## Truth tables

Complete the `truth` tables for the three circuits that you completed in this activity. In addition,
link to each of the schematics you made for the circuits in `TinkerCAD`.

## Speculation

> As an example, describe the `AND` circuit's functionality. Address:
> * how current flows when the switches engaged/disengaged
> * how the transistors enable this functionality
>
> _Tip:_ It might be helpful to attempt to draw this out; follow the example of the `NOT` gate we made in lab.

`TODO`

> We have some basic building blocks of a digital circuit. Do you have any ideas as to how these can be applied (separately or together)
> to do anything useful or meaningful? If so, what could we do with these bits of logic? Can we make anything more complex?

`TODO`

> What do you think happens if you switch out the resistors for `2.2K` and `220` ohm versions (in the correct places)? What actually
> happens?
